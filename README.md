# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Neural-ODEs-Neural-Ordinary-Differential-Equations-
This project focuses on forecasting time series data using Neural ODEs by learning patterns in continuous time instead of fixed time steps. It compares LSTM with Neural ODE, Neural CDE, and Latent ODE models to show how continuous-time approaches handle complex and real-world data more effectively.
